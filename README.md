Worked on a dataset containing past loans information of 346 customers whose loans are already paid or defaulted.
It includes fields such as Loan_status, Principal, Effective_date, Due_date, etc. Performed exploratory data analysis, wrangling, and normalization.
Trained 4 machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression.
Tested the accuracy of the trained models using another dataset of 54 customers and accuracy metrics such as the Jaccard Index, F1 score, and Log Loss.
